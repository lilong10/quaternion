Color Image Signal Processing by Quaternion Arithmetic 

Something I developed as a graduate student https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/ between 2003-2005.

Core image processing by quaternion representation can be found in my thesis "Exploration in quaternion colour" (2005) https://summit.sfu.ca/item/9829 

Later extended to more applications:

- Quaternion PCA/SVD
- Quaternion compression
- Quaternion edge detection
- Quaternion texture
- Quaternion curvature
- Quaternion segmentation
- Quaternion classification
